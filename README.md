# auto_boundingbox_cropper
Auto boundingbox cropper using OpenCV in python, the programme uses an image as reference, that's an image already cropped. Then the SIFT algorithm in OpenCV is used to find the corresponding bounding box image in the target image. Finally, the target image is cropped.

This programme is useful while building dataset for image classification in tensorflow as an annotation tool.
